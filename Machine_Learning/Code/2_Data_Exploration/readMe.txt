| Data_Exploration.R | 
----------------------
This R file allows to make some generic analysis about the dataset that is going to be used for the Machine Learning part of the current project, such as:
- Precipitation analysis
- Find total flights/delayed flights
- Find flights/delaye flights per days of week

-------------------------------
| Airports_Exploration_Corr.R |

This R file allows to make a correlation matrix between all the flights between the ATL airport and an another airport up to the user.
The correlation matrix is calculating the Pearson Coefficient between the following columns:
- Scheduled_Departure
- Scheduled_Arrival
- Scheduled_Time
- Arrival_Delay
- MaxTemp
- MinTemp
