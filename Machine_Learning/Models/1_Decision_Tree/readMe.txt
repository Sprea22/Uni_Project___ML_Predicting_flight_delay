| Decision_Tree_Training.R |
----------------------------
This R files allows the user to train a Decision Tree model with an arbitrary set of parameters. Furthermore, it saves the generated model in the same folder (format .rda).

------------------------
| Decision_Tree_Test.R |
------------------------
This R files allows the user to test a Decision Tree model with an arbitrary set of parameters. It's possible to load an already generated Decision Tree model and it will give a performances measures list as output, that is also saved as excel file in the same repository.

----------------------------
| _Decision_Tree_Model.rda |
----------------------------
This file represents an already generated Decision Tree model.

------------------
| DT_Results.rds |
------------------
This file is a R data frame that contains the real values and the predicted values of the current model. It's autogenerated when a model is tested, and it's automatically used by the "Models_Performance_Evaluation.R" to create the ROC Graph.
