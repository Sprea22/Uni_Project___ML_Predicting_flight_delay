| Neural_Network_Training.R |
-----------------------------
This R files allows the user to train a Neural Network model with an arbitrary set of parameters. Furthermore, it saves the generated model in the same folder (format .rda).

-------------------------
| Neural_Network_Test.R |
-------------------------
This R files allows the user to test a Neural Network model with an arbitrary set of parameters. It's possible to load an already generated Neural Network model and it will give a performances measures list as output, that is also saved as excel file in the same repository.

-----------------------------
| _Neural_Network_Model.rda |
-----------------------------
This file represents an already generated Neural Network model.

------------------
| NN_Results.rds |
------------------
This file is a R data frame that contains the real values and the predicted values of the current model. It's autogenerated when a model is tested, and it's automatically used by the "Models_Performance_Evaluation.R" to create the ROC Graph.
